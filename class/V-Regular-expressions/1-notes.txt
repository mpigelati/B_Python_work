Basic Regular expressions
. (dot) - a single character.
^ - matches the beginning of the line.
$ - matches the end of the line.
* - the preceding character matches 0 or more times.
\	Represent special characters
() - allows us to group several characters to behave as one.
? - the preceding character matches 0 or 1 times only.

Interval Regular expressions
{n}   - the preceding character matches exactly n times.
{n,m} - the preceding character matches at least n times and not more than m times.
{n, } -  Matches the preceding character only when it appears 'n' times or more

Extended regular expressions
\+ - Matches one or more occurrence of the previous character
\? - Matches zero or one occurrence of the previous character

[agd] - the character is one of those included within the square brackets.
[^agd] - the character is not one of those included within the square brackets.
[c-f] - the dash within the square brackets operates as a range. In this case it means either the letters c, d, e or f.
| (pipe symbol) - the logical OR operation.
